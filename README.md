Building
------
1. Download and install/setup the prerequisites from [the libgdx github wiki](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Prerequisites). 
2. Clone this repository and in Eclipse import the `angelgame-android` project as an "Existing Android code into workspace". Import the other projects as "Existing Projects into Workspace".
  * You will probably see a bunch of errors. We're about to fix them.
3. Download the libdgx setup tool from `http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/nightlies/dist/gdx-setup-ui.jar`
4. Add the correct libraries to the build path
  1. Locate the project folders which you imported earlier
  2. Download a libgdx version. We use the nightly (click the "N")
  3. Update

If you have issues look up how to setup and build on the [libgdx github wiki.](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki)
